# airtest_demo
A short demo showing the power of airtest api and poco using cookie clicker as the target game.
I used Bluestacks 5.8.0.1079 N64 for testing but I believe any android device will work.

Required Packages:
airtest
pocoui

Usage:
- Open Chrome on the Android devices
- Navigate to https://iogames.onl/cookie-clicker
- Scroll down enough to be able to see the big cookie
- Make sure the device is connected over USB
- Run main.py
- Watch cookies get clicked

It will work in the background or minimized and the device resolution doesnt matter :)
